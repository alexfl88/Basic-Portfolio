            <p>Hello! My name is Alex Lee and I was born in San Francisco, California. I graduated from UCLA in 2018 where I majored in Sociology and minored in Cultural Anthropology. Coding and software development have always fascinated me because of their applications to essentially anything in the job industry. Since technology is a continually evolving field, I hope that gaining expertise in this discipline will allow me to make a positive influence in the vast expanding industry. Outside of software development I am very passionate about physical health. I love to practice martial arts, play tennis, and work out at the gym. I am also a huge fan of the San Francisco Giants, the Golden State Warriors, and the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
